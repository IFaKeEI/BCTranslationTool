# TranslationTool
Hello,  

This is a WinForms app made for translating the Xliff translation files used for Business Central translations. This App have been made in consideration of the [NAB AL Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nabsolutions.nab-al-tools) VS Code extension's file manipulation. However this app should work completely fine if you don't use this VS Code extension yourself.

## How to use
Step 1: Launch the app.  
Step 2: Navigate to a File menu and select the Upload button.  
Step 3: Upload your Xliff translation file.  
Step 4: Make changes to the translation App.  
Step 5: Navigate to the File menu again and select the Save As button.  
Step 6: Save the file in your project's translations folder.  
Step 7: Check the translations.  
Step 8: It's done, now take a break, making translations is exhausting. :)
